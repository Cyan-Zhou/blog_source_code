# 3 trajectories research

## I. JD programs 

JD, Juris Doctor, basically works like March1 in architectural school, or Bachelor in Law, kind of. If you want to pass Bar Exam in US, JD is a good option. International students can work as **consultant in NGOs, patent prosecution agents, legal counsel for large companies or start-ups, or to business management, consulting, investment banking...**

{{<admonition info "Top 14 Law Schools" true >}}

T1: Yale, Stanford, Harvard

T2: U Chicago, Columbia, NYU

T3: UPenn, Michigan, UVA, Duke, Northwestern, Berkeley, Cornell, UT Austin, *Georgetown*

{{< /admonition >}}

### Trajectory

Take Columbia University as an example, 

#### Year 1

Several required courses on different laws to build knowledge structure on law practice. Practice writing. There will be one optional course in spring. 

Summer Internship is a chance to choose your own direction. [OCI]^(On-Campus Interview) is important if you want to work in Big Law. 

#### Year 2 

Some courses on higher level law, like company law, human right, national history, tax... Practice a lot on writing and thesis. Prepare for the summer internship in summer. 

#### Year 3

Spend most time on looking for a job and prepare for exam, like NYLE or MPRE. 

### Admission Requirement

1. Best GPA, S or AA, [LSAC]^(the Law School Admission Councils) will take 1-2 month to evaluate the score, known as [CAS]^(Credential Assembly Service). 
2. LSAT score is super important. 3 times most in a testing year. LSAT > GRE in terms of importance. At least 170-174
3. Internship is also preferred. 
4. 2 recommendation letters come from professors, 1 from work. 
5. Personal statement
6. Diversity Statement

### Cost

85,000 - 95,000 USD/year roughly

### Timeline

| Time | Schedule |
| ------- | ------------- |
| Summer 					 | Mail GPA to LSAC; ask for recommendation letters| 
| Aug - Oct 					| Personal Statement, CV, pass LSAT tests, get recommendation letters |
| Before Thanksgiving | Submit all materials |
| Nov - Mar					| Interview |

### Advantages

* Most law schools of T14 has 12 scores to access other majors' courses
* Since there isn't bachelor in law in US, the background of students are very different
* Logic and creativity
* High revenue

### Disadvantages

* Many universities admit a few international students. Harvard and Columbia | Cornell and Georgetown is more friendly to international students.

## II. Tech / Computer Science

### Cornell Tech - MS with a Concentration in Urban Tech

{{< admonition info "Target" open>}}

Learn to apply machine learning, data science, human-computer interaction, and product design to the social, economic and technical challenges of a city in this transformational program. Our first-of-its-kind curriculum challenges you with the rigor of a computer science core, a firm grounding in how cities work and room to test your biggest ideas by building real products in the Studio.

{{< /admonition >}}

#### Why this?

* Tech is the core, which means candidates must show the ability to tackle computer science courses. 
* XR/AR/Internet of Things start-ups
* If it need relevant experience, I can be an assistance at THU Architecture school, with a professor I've worked with earlier on parametric design. 
* Alternation option is the other dual Master Degree - Connective Media Concentration, but it wants strong computing skills (or like the urban one)
